WYSIWYG, *What You See Is What You Get* software makes text editing easy. [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is an easy-to-read, easy-to-write text-to-html conversion tool that falls into the category of WYSIWYG content editors. The goal being to make formatted text as readable as possible - with minimal mark up (hence the name). Frequently used to format [readme](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github) files and write messages in online forums, I use Markdown to blog.

[Osbornnick.com/blog](http://osbornnick.com/blog) is built using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and Markdown.
